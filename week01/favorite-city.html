    <h1> My Favorite City </h1>
    <p> My favorite city is full of life, culture, and history. Every street has a
        unique character, from the old buildings that tell stories of the past
        to the modern cafes where people gather every day. Walking through the
        city feels like stepping into a place where tradition and innovation
        meet in harmony.</p>
